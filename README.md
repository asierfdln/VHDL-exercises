This a compilation of VHDL exercises and a final project developed for the Programmable Logic subject at University of Deusto, 2019-2020. Each folder contains the VHDL code handed in to the professor, as well as a showcase video detailing the funcionting of the synthesized code on a [Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board](https://www.amazon.es/xc7-a35t-basys-Entrada-183p-kit-digilent/dp/B00NUE1WOG/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3H8FIUCUKOWLW&keywords=basys+3&qid=1692967185&sprefix=basys+3%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.5e544547-1f8e-4072-8c08-ed563e39fc7d). We were awarded with the highest mark with honors for the work done.

The final project, project 10, serves as a compendium of all previous exercises into one single program containing control logic for a stopwatch, a binary-BCD conversor, an alarm clock, control of a servo motor (various modes) and a DC motor. The final report (in Spanish) describes the input functions of each button and switch available, as it is quite a convoluted program.

Covid-19 hit us during this semester, so all projects from 05 to 10 were developed using the remote laboratories provided by the university, with same FPGA boards such that each remote station was already set up with all the circuitry and cable management for the various external components.
